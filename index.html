                Kaleidoscopes function on the principle of multiple reflection.
                Using several mirrors angled precisely from one another they are
                able to turn bits of colored glass into a perfectly symmetrical
                work of ever changing art. My studies and life experiences as an
                interdisciplinarian have come together like the parts of a
                kaleidoscope.
              </p>

              <p>
                The mirrors in my life are my areas of study that have allowed
                me to be involved in several amazing ventures and adventures.
                Being involved in health and computer sciences has allowed me to
                build my kaleidoscope, but without my focus on entrepreneurship
                I would not have the momentum to generate the art in my life.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an entrepreneur I take great pride in my past ventures
                because every failure and every mistake is a chance to keep
                turning my scope and although with every turn I lose the
                beautiful art that once was – I know that the pieces are still
                there and beautiful art is right around the corner. There have
                been two specific ventures that left a remarkable impact on me.
                Both of these ventures involved me being in a leadership
                position reporting directly to the CEO and in both cases I was
                able to witness incredible feats of injustice and mismanagement.
                Seeing how these people treated the people that worked for them
                allowed me to realize my dream of managing and developing
                businesses while maintaining a sense of morals and respect for
                those that help you on a daily basis. I want to use my skills
                and past experiences to help people realize their potential and
                their organization’s potential. My experiences in the healthcare
                industry, technological background, and business mentality are
                the perfect components to any compassion focused scope of
                business.
